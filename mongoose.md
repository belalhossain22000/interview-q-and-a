# Mongoose Interview Questions and Answers

### Mongoose Basics:

1. **What is Mongoose in the context of Node.js and MongoDB?**
   - **Answer:** Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model application data, enforce data validation, and interact with MongoDB.

2. **Explain the key features of Mongoose.**
   - **Answer:** Mongoose features include schema definition, data validation, query building, middleware support, population (referencing documents), and easy integration with MongoDB.

3. **How do you establish a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** To connect to MongoDB using Mongoose, you use the `mongoose.connect()` method, providing the MongoDB connection URI as a parameter.

### Schemas and Models:

4. **What is a schema in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** A schema in Mongoose defines the structure of the documents within a collection and specifies the properties, types, and validation rules.

5. **Explain how to create a Mongoose model.**
   - **Answer:** A Mongoose model is created by defining a schema and then compiling it into a model using `mongoose.model()`.

### CRUD Operations:

6. **How do you perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** CRUD operations are executed using Mongoose methods:
     - Create: `Model.create()`
     - Read: `Model.find()`, `Model.findOne()`
     - Update: `Model.updateOne()`, `Model.findByIdAndUpdate()`
     - Delete: `Model.deleteOne()`, `Model.findByIdAndDelete()`

7. **Discuss the use of Mongoose middleware in CRUD operations.**
   - **Answer:** Mongoose middleware functions such as `pre` and `post` hooks allow executing logic before or after specific operations like `save`, `update`, or `remove`.

### Querying and Population:

8. **How do you perform complex queries with Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Mongoose supports query building using methods like `find()`, `sort()`, `limit()`, `skip()`, and additional filtering using query operators.

9. **Explain the concept of population in Mongoose.**
   - **Answer:** Population in Mongoose allows referencing documents in other collections. It involves filling in data from referenced documents when querying, enhancing query results.

### Validation and Middleware:

10. **How does Mongoose handle data validation?**
    - **Answer:** Mongoose offers built-in validators and custom validation logic within schemas to ensure data integrity and enforce validation rules.

11. **Discuss the types of middleware available in Mongoose and their use cases.**
    - **Answer:** Mongoose middleware includes `pre` and `post` hooks that intercept operations like `save`, `update`, or `remove` to perform additional tasks or modify data.

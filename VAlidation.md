# Mongoose Validation and Advanced Methods Interview Questions

### Validation in Mongoose:

1. **What is the importance of validation in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Validation ensures that the data inserted or updated in the database meets predefined criteria, maintaining data integrity and consistency.

2. **How do you perform custom validation in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Custom validation in Mongoose involves defining custom validation logic within the schema by specifying functions or using hooks like `pre` and `post`.

### Using Validator, Joi, and Zod for Validation:

3. **What are the differences between using Validator, Joi, and Zod for data validation in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Validator, Joi, and Zod are different validation libraries used in Mongoose. Validator focuses on simple validations, Joi provides a robust validation framework with a fluent API, while Zod offers a TypeScript-first approach to validation.

4. **Discuss the process of implementing validation using Joi in Mongoose.**
   - **Answer:** Implementing validation using Joi in Mongoose involves defining schemas using Joi and applying these schemas to Mongoose models to validate data.

5. **How does one implement validation using Zod in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Zod allows defining schemas in a TypeScript-like syntax and validating data by applying these schemas to Mongoose models, ensuring type safety and validation.

### Custom Methods, Middleware, and Virtuals:

6. **Explain the process of implementing a custom instance method in Mongoose.**
   - **Answer:** Implementing a custom instance method in Mongoose involves adding methods to the schema's methods object to perform operations on individual document instances.

7. **How is a custom static method implemented in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** A custom static method in Mongoose is defined by adding functions to the schema's statics object, allowing operations at the model level.

8. **Discuss the significance and implementation of Mongoose middleware.**
   - **Answer:** Mongoose middleware provides hooks that enable running functions before or after specific operations such as `save`, `validate`, `remove`, etc., offering a way to modify data or execute additional logic.

9. **Explain an alternative method to delete data in Mongoose.**
   - **Answer:** An alternative to traditional deletion involves setting a field (e.g., `isDeleted`) instead of physically removing data, enabling soft deletion for better traceability.

10. **How are query middlewares implemented in Mongoose, and what purpose do they serve?**
    - **Answer:** Query middlewares in Mongoose intercept and modify queries before or after execution, allowing custom operations or data manipulation.

11. **Discuss the use cases and functionality of Mongoose Virtuals.**
    - **Answer:** Mongoose Virtuals are properties that are not stored in the database but can be derived from other fields, enhancing model data presentation without storing redundant information.

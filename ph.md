# University Management System - Software Development Lifecycle Interview Questions

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Project Start:

1. **Explain the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). How would you initiate a project using SDLC methodologies?**
   - **Answer:** SDLC is a structured approach to software development encompassing planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. Project initiation involves requirements gathering, feasibility analysis, project charter creation, and team allocation.

### Project Phases - Requirement Analysis, Data Modeling, and Design:

2. **Discuss the significance of Requirement Analysis for a university management system project.**
   - **Answer:** Requirement Analysis involves understanding and documenting user needs, system functionalities, and constraints, serving as a foundation for system development.

3. **Explain the process of modeling data for a university management system.**
   - **Answer:** Data modeling involves defining data entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints to create a structured representation of the university system's data.

4. **How do you design a schema and Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a university management system?**
   - **Answer:** Schema design includes defining database structure using entities, attributes, and relationships. ER diagrams visually represent these relationships and entities in a structured manner.

### Development Phases - API Endpoints, User Interface, and Refactoring:

5. **Discuss the process of creating API endpoints for a university management system.**
   - **Answer:** Creating API endpoints involves defining routes and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various system functionalities like managing students, courses, etc.

6. **Explain the steps involved in creating a user interface, model, and validation for a university management system.**
   - **Answer:** Creating a user interface includes designing screens, implementing models to represent data, and validating user input to ensure data integrity.

7. **What is the significance of refactoring in software development? Discuss the aspects involved in refactoring user validation, routes, controllers, and services.**
   - **Answer:** Refactoring improves code quality and maintainability. It involves restructuring existing code without altering its external behavior, ensuring better readability and scalability.

### Implementation and Bug Fixing:

8. **Describe the process of creating a user as a student in a university management system.**
   - **Answer:** Creating a user as a student involves defining user roles, assigning privileges, and managing student-specific data within the system.

9. **Explain the process of fixing bugs and setting up a basic global error handler in a university management system project.**
   - **Answer:** Fixing bugs involves identifying, troubleshooting, and resolving issues in the system. Setting up a global error handler ensures consistent error handling across the application.

### Routing, Module Summary, and System Finalization:

10. **How would you create a not-found route and implement a sendResponse utility in a university management system?**
    - **Answer:** Not-found routes handle requests for invalid routes, while a sendResponse utility standardizes and centralizes the way responses are sent back to clients.

11. **Discuss the significance of an index route and summarize the key modules of a university management system project.**
    - **Answer:** Index routes serve as entry points to the application. Summarizing key modules involves highlighting major components and functionalities developed throughout the project.

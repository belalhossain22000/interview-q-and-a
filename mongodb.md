# MongoDB Aggregation Framework Interview Questions

### Introduction to the Powerful Aggregation Framework:

1. **What is the MongoDB Aggregation Framework, and why is it considered powerful for data manipulation?**
   - **Answer:** The MongoDB Aggregation Framework is a pipeline-based data processing paradigm allowing users to perform complex operations on data. It enables data transformation, filtering, grouping, and computation, ideal for analytical processing.

### Aggregation Pipeline Stages:

2. **Explain the usage of aggregation stages like `$match`, `$project`, `$addFields`, `$out`, and `$merge`.**
   - **Answer:** These stages allow filtering, reshaping documents, adding new fields, and outputting data to collections. Section 6-1 to 6-4 provide detailed insights into these stages.

3. **How does the `$group` stage work in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework, and what are its commonly used operators like `$sum` and `$push`?**
   - **Answer:** The `$group` stage groups documents by specified fields and performs operations like summing values (`$sum`) and pushing values into arrays (`$push`). Refer to section 6-3 for comprehensive details.

4. **What is the purpose of `$unwind` and `$bucket` stages in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework?**
   - **Answer:** `$unwind` splits array fields into separate documents, while `$bucket` categorizes documents into groups based on specified boundaries. Section 6-5 and 6-6 provide insights into their functionalities.

### Advanced Aggregation Pipeline:

5. **Explain the usage of stages like `$sort`, `$limit`, `$facet`, and `$lookup` in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework.**
   - **Answer:** These stages are utilized for sorting, limiting results, performing multiple independent pipelines (`$facet`), and performing joins (`$lookup`). Refer to sections 6-6 to 6-8 for detailed explanations.

6. **What are indexing and the differences between COLLSCAN and IXSCAN?**
   - **Answer:** Indexing is the process of optimizing data retrieval. COLLSCAN refers to collection scan, while IXSCAN refers to index scan. IXSCAN utilizes indexes for faster queries compared to COLLSCAN. Section 6-9 covers indexing details.

7. **Discuss compound index and text index in MongoDB and their significance.**
   - **Answer:** Compound index involves indexing multiple fields together for improved query performance, while text index is used for full-text search. Section 6-10 elaborates on these index types.

### Practical Task on MongoDB Aggregation:

8. **Can you describe a practical task involving the MongoDB Aggregation Framework, covering multiple stages?**
   - **Answer:** Practice tasks provided in Module 6 involve applying various aggregation stages to achieve specific data processing objectives, enhancing understanding and proficiency in the Aggregation Framework.

### Quiz Test:

9. **How can a quiz test help solidify understanding and knowledge of the MongoDB Aggregation Framework?**
   - **Answer:** A quiz test assesses comprehension and retention of concepts, reinforcing understanding and identifying areas for further study.

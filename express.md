# Express.js Interview Questions and Answers

### Node.js and Module Concepts:

1. **What is Node.js, and why is it favored for server-side development?**
   - **Answer:** Node.js is a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows running JavaScript code on the server-side. It's favored for its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture, ideal for scalable applications.

2. **Explain the concept of modules in Node.js. What are the differences between CommonJS and ES Modules (ESM)?**
   - **Answer:** Modules in Node.js are reusable pieces of code. CommonJS uses `require` and `module.exports` for module handling, while ESM uses `import` and `export` statements, adhering to ES6 standards.

### File System, Event-Driven Architecture, and Streams:

3. **What is the File System Module in Node.js, and what are the differences between synchronous and asynchronous file operations?**
   - **Answer:** The File System Module (`fs`) allows interaction with the file system. Synchronous operations block the execution until the operation completes, while asynchronous operations don't block and allow for parallel execution.

4. **Explain the concept of Event-Driven Architecture and creating custom events in Node.js.**
   - **Answer:** Event-Driven Architecture revolves around events and listeners. In Node.js, the `EventEmitter` class is used to create custom events and handle them with event listeners.

5. **Discuss Streams and Buffers in Node.js. How do you create your own server using Streams and Buffers?**
   - **Answer:** Streams are a collection of data that might not be available all at once. Buffers are temporary storage areas for streams. Creating a server involves using streams to handle request and response data efficiently.

### Express.js Framework:

6. **What steps are involved in installing Express.js and TypeScript in a Node.js project?**
   - **Answer:** Use npm (Node Package Manager) to install Express.js and TypeScript as dependencies in a Node.js project.

7. **Explain the role of parsers, request, and response objects in Express.js.**
   - **Answer:** Parsers in Express.js handle incoming request data (e.g., body-parser for parsing JSON data). Request and response objects represent the HTTP request and response.

8. **Discuss middleware in Express.js. What is its purpose and how is it implemented?**
   - **Answer:** Middleware in Express.js sits between the incoming request and the final route handler. It intercepts requests, performs actions, and can modify request and response objects before passing control to the next middleware.

9. **How is routing handled in Express.js, and what are its core features?**
   - **Answer:** Routing in Express.js maps HTTP request methods and URLs to specific request-handling functions or controllers. It defines the endpoints and actions to be performed based on incoming requests.

10. **Explain the concept of an error handler in Express.js.**
    - **Answer:** Express.js allows the creation of custom error handling middleware to manage errors that occur during request processing.

# Node.js Basic to Intermediate Level Interview Questions and Answers

### Node.js Basics:

1. **What is Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows executing JavaScript code outside a web browser, making it suitable for server-side development.

2. **Explain the features of Node.js.**
   - **Answer:** Node.js features non-blocking I/O, event-driven architecture, asynchronous programming, and the ability to create scalable and lightweight applications.

3. **How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?**
   - **Answer:** Node.js utilizes callbacks, Promises, and async/await to handle asynchronous operations. It employs non-blocking I/O to ensure efficient handling of concurrent requests.

### Modules and NPM:

4. **What are modules in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** Modules in Node.js are reusable pieces of code that encapsulate functionality. They can be imported using `require()` and exported using `module.exports` or `exports`.

5. **What is NPM in the context of Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages/modules.

6. **How do you include external libraries in a Node.js application?**
   - **Answer:** External libraries are included using the `require()` function to import modules. They can be installed via NPM and then imported into the code.

### File System and Streams:

7. **Explain the File System module in Node.js.**
   - **Answer:** The File System module (`fs`) provides APIs to interact with the file system. It allows reading, writing, updating, deleting files, and more.

8. **Discuss Streams in Node.js.**
   - **Answer:** Streams are objects that enable reading or writing data continuously. They can be readable, writable, or both and are used for handling large amounts of data efficiently.

### Event Loop and Asynchronous Programming:

9. **What is the Event Loop in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** The Event Loop is a core concept in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations. It manages the execution of multiple operations by allowing non-blocking I/O operations.

10. **Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js.**
    - **Answer:** Synchronous operations block the execution until the task is completed, while asynchronous operations allow the program to continue executing other tasks without waiting for the completion of the current task.

### Error Handling and Debugging:

11. **How do you handle errors in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** Errors in Node.js can be handled using try-catch blocks, using `catch` with Promises, or by implementing error-first callbacks.

12. **Discuss the tools and techniques used for debugging Node.js applications.**
    - **Answer:** Node.js applications can be debugged using built-in debugging features like `console.log()`, `debugger` keyword, or by using debuggers like VSCode debugger or Node Inspector.

### Middleware and Express.js:

13. **What is middleware in Express.js?**
    - **Answer:** Middleware in Express.js are functions that have access to the request, response objects, and the `next()` function. They are used to execute code, modify request/response objects, or terminate the request-response cycle.

14. **Explain the role of Express.js in Node.js development.**
    - **Answer:** Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features and middleware.
